      +e.P.secondary-descr.lg An excellent vintage with warm days and cool nights. Spring frosts wiped out blocks on lower sites with poor cold air drainage. This resulted in a lower regional crush but quality was high due to it only being from the most suitable sites. A hot and dry growing season resulted in balanced canopies with low yields and concentrated fruit. Some rainfall occurred during February & March which was a positive as it refreshed the vines and gave them sufficient water to get through to harvest with minimal stress. There was no disease pressure due to the great canopies and low yields.
